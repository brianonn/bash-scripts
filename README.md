# bin-scripts

This is a place for my own scripts that I populate into ~/bin on any
host I setup for my own use. This repository can hold any type of script
or even C code for a small, standalone utility. In the future I might
include a Makefile and installer to make symlinks from the clone to ~/bin

The point is that anytime I create a new host I would like to have my
own bin scripts, and I can simply clone this on a new host.

Done this way, it will also be useful for new virtual machines created
by hand or as a setup step in [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/),
[Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/), or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
